# People Counter
## Overview

This is a simple web-based counter that allows users to increment and save the number of people who have entered a space. The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to track the count and display previous entries. It's perfect for anyone looking to learn the basics of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
